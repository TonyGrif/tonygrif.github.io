I am a graduate student at Old Dominion University, where I am pursuing a Master’s degree in
Data Science after earning my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the same institution.
My current academic interests center on phase space reconstruction and physics-informed neural networks
where I focus on leveraging machine learning to tackle complex challenges relating to accelerator physics.

As I continue my studies, I am eager to deepen my expertise in predictive modeling, machine learning,
and computational simulations, while working on impactful projects in data science for physics.
