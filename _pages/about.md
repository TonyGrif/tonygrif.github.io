I am a graduate student at Old Dominion University, where I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science after earning my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the same institution.
My academic interests center on time series forecasting, weather prediction, and data engineering, where I focus on leveraging statistical modeling, machine learning, and scalable data pipelines to tackle complex challenges.

As I continue my studies, I am eager to deepen my expertise in predictive modeling, machine learning, and large-scale data systems, while working on impactful projects in forecasting and environmental data science.
